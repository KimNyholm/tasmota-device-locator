# Tasmota Device Locator

Locate Tasmota Devices on your network when you only know the subnet of the device.
The search is done with javascript in a browser and no software installation is required.
Only newer devices with CORS support will be found.

## Usage

Enter any ip address in the subnet and it will search for devices on the whole subnet. E.g. specify 192.168.0.121 to locate all devices in the range 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255.

If the devices are password protected also enter the password. The password will be tried on all devices. If they have different passwords, more searches must be done.
